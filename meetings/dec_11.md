# Project meeting December 11th 11:00

Since last time Kim and Sebastian has implemented functions that creates a scalable network so we can run on arbitrary input data length. Edward and Oscar has implemented an input data generator that takes input from video files and generates spike arrays from these videos.

The next meeting will be focused on trying to merge the input data and the network together. 

Next meeting scheduled for Monday the 14th 10:15.
