# Project meeting December 4th 10:15

Since last time we have tried to get a better grasp of the problem by finishing/progressing on SNN2 as well as doing individual research. Sebastian showed a basic implementation to solve the problem in neuronify.

Talked about how to progress further. Investigating if we can generate our own training data with the goal of running the system with web cam input eventually. We also wish to implement the system with Brian2 so some further investigation of that framework will be done until the next meeting. We decided to split into two groups, one for the training data and one for the Brian2 network implementation.

Initially Edward & Oscar will be responsible for generating training data while Sebastian and Kim will research how to implement the basic neuronify example in Brian2.

#### Questions for the next project session
 - How to go about generating your own training data? Is it a good idea?
 - Supervised/unsupervised learning?
 - How does the input spikes work exactly? Some clarification of the problem would be nice.

#### Until next meeting
 - Some sort of input generation idea should be done
 - Some functioning Brian2 example code should have been written

Next meeting scheduled for Tuesday the 8th at 16:30.
